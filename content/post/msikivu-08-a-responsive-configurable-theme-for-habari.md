After some prodding from GitHub user jniggemann (thanks!), I finally got around to addressing some of my Msikivu todo list. For those interested in more details on Msikivu, check out my [earlier post](http://imperialwicket.com/msikivu-a-responsive-configurable-theme-for-habari). In short, the following enhancements are present in the 0.8.3 release:

1.  Habari 0.8.x compatibility (Sorry this took so long...)
2.  Two additional stylesheets added. There is a 'blue' (which is oddly Drupal-ish and doesn't quite support IE - though to be honest I haven't really tested Msikivu's general IE support...) and a 'custom' (which is pretty devoid of non-positional styling, and ideal for creating your own custom Msikivu look and feel).
3.  Adds a 1200px wide grid to Skeleton for nicer presentation on widescreens (IMO).

There are still a couple issues with the comments interface on the iPhone, and I plan to make some cosmetic updates to the admin area as well. Note that if you want a lighter weight and less configurability-focused responsive base template, I also put together [iwBase](http://imperialwicket.com/iwbase-a-responsive-starter-theme-for-habari) as a responsive starter theme for Habari 0.8 and greater.

Feel free to post requests for either theme in the comments here at imperialwicket.com or log an issue in the appropriate [GitHub](https://github.com/imperialwicket) repository, and I'll try to make updates.
