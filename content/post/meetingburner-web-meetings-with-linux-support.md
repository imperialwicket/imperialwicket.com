I've been using MeetingBurner for a long time, and have been entirely pleased with their offerings. Since I've used Linux only machines for many years, I've needed to borrow machines or run licensed software inside virtual machines on the occasions when some project/individual requires a non-Linux compatible solution (GoToMeeting!). 

### My GoToMeeting Linux Alternative:

Here's [my affiliate link](http://volcanic.enterthemeeting.com/join) if you're interested. The free offering should solve the issue for most users, and anyone who needs more services in their web meeting software will find the paid plans are extremely competitive when compared to others in this space.
