I am Nicholas Whittier and I describe myself as a DIYer, a Linux fan-boy, an open source enthusiast, and a lover of lawn sports. I read the Great Books of Western Civilization, and I think I understand some of them.  

I have spent a good deal of time cloud-wrangling, mostly in the AWS. I like immutable infrastructure; I'm easily nerd-sniped by anything CI/CD; I have *strong* opinions about dependency management. I completed a not-so-short stint as an Engineering Manager of various platform engineering teams, and I now find myself swinging back to the individual contributor side of [the pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) with new insights.

### Get in touch!

I enjoy platform rubber-ducking, and I tend to gravitate toward _what breaks next_ in a given organization or software solution. Is it the database? When? 10x growth? Is it the cache? When does the build pipeline become a blocker? What's the security posture? Could this pass an audit comfortably?

I genuinely love to chat about these things, and I'm likely available for contract work if you think I can help (I can). If you've made it this far, reach out to my github username at google's email service, I respond to all serious inquiries.
