I am Nicholas Whittier, and this is my blog.  I describe myself as a DIYer, a Linux fan-boy, an open source enthusiast, and a lover of lawn sports. I read the Great Books of Western Civilization, and I think I understood a couple of them.  

Lately, I spend much of my time cloud-wrangling, mostly in the AWS. I like immutable infrastructure and ChatOps.
