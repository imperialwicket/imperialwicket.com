I am Nicholas Whittier, and this is my blog.  I describe myself as a DIYer, a Linux fan-boy, an opensource enthusiast, and a lover of lawn sports.  The internet has led me to commonly over-investigate most things.  Many times I spend weeks trying to determine the most appropriate product for my needs, only to decide that I did not need that product from the start.  I will let [xkcd: DFS](http://xkcd.com/761/) offer a non-commercial explanation.

Lately, I spend much of my time cloud-wrangling, mostly in the AWS.
